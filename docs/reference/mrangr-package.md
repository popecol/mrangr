# mrangr: Mechanistic Metacommunity Simulator

Flexible, mechanistic, and spatially explicit simulator of
metacommunities. It extends the 'rangr' package, which implemented a
mechanistic virtual species simulator integrating population dynamics
and dispersal. The 'mrangr' package adds the ability to simulate
multiple species interacting through an asymmetric matrix of pairwise
relationships, allowing users to model all types of biotic interactions
— competitive, facilitative, or neutral — within spatially explicit
virtual environments.
