# Example Of Interaction Coefficients Matrix

A square numeric matrix representing interaction coefficients between
species. `a_ij` is the per-capita interaction strength of species `j` on
species `i`. It expresses the change in carrying capacity of species `i`
by a single individual of species `j`. This data is compatible with
[`n1_map_eg.tif`](n1_map_eg.tif.md) and
[`K_map_eg.tif`](K_map_eg.tif.md) maps.

## Usage

``` r
a_eg
```

## Format

A numeric matrix with 4 rows and 4 columns containing interaction
coefficients.
