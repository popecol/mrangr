# mrangr: Mechanistic Metacommunity Simulator

Flexible, mechanistic, and spatially explicit simulator of
metacommunities. It extends our previous package - 'rangr' (see
<https://github.com/ropensci/rangr>), which implemented a mechanistic
virtual species simulator integrating population dynamics and dispersal.
The 'mrangr' package adds the ability to simulate multiple species
interacting through an asymmetric matrix of pairwise relationships,
allowing users to model all types of biotic interactions — competitive,
facilitative, or neutral — within spatially explicit virtual
environments.
