Description: Flexible, mechanistic, and spatially explicit simulator of
    metacommunities. It extends our previous package - 'rangr' (see
    <https://github.com/ropensci/rangr>), which implemented a mechanistic
    virtual species simulator integrating population dynamics and
    dispersal. The 'mrangr' package adds the ability to simulate multiple
    species interacting through an asymmetric matrix of pairwise
    relationships, allowing users to model all types of biotic
    interactions — competitive, facilitative, or neutral — within
    spatially explicit virtual environments. This work was supported by 
    the National Science Centre, Poland, grant no. 2018/29/B/NZ8/00066 and 
    the Poznań Supercomputing and Networking Centre (grant no. pl0090-01).
